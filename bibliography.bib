Gaining biological insight from the result of such experiments can be approached, for instance, by identifying the signaling pathways impacted by the observed changes. Most of the existing pathway analysis methods focus on either the number of DE genes observed in a given pathway (enrichment analysis methods), or on the correlation between the pathway genes and the class of the samples (functional class scoring methods). Both approaches treat the pathways as simple sets of genes, disregarding the complex gene interactions that these pathways are built to describe.},

  abstract = "Although genomewide RNA expression analysis has become a routine
              tool in biomedical research, extracting biological insight from
              such information remains a major challenge. Here, we describe a
              powerful analytical method called Gene Set Enrichment Analysis
              (GSEA) for interpreting gene expression data. The method derives
              its power by focusing on gene sets, that is, groups of genes that
              share common biological function, chromosomal location, or
              regulation. We demonstrate how GSEA yields insights into several
              cancer-related data sets, including leukemia and lung cancer.
              Notably, where single-gene analysis finds little similarity
              between two independent studies of patient survival in lung
              cancer, GSEA reveals many biological pathways in common. The GSEA
              method is embodied in a freely available software package,
              together with an initial database of 1,325 biologically defined
              gene sets.",

	abstract = {The Reactome Knowledgebase (https://reactome.org), an Elixir core resource, provides manually curated molecular details across a broad range of physiological and pathological biological processes in humans, including both hereditary and acquired disease processes. The processes are annotated as an ordered network of molecular transformations in a single consistent data model. Reactome thus functions both as a digital archive of manually curated human biological processes and as a tool for discovering functional relationships in data such as gene expression profiles or somatic mutation catalogs from tumor cells. Recent curation work has expanded our annotations of normal and disease-associated signaling processes and of the drugs that target them, in particular infections caused by the SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 coronaviruses and the host response to infection. New tools support better simultaneous analysis of high-throughput data from multiple sources and the placement of understudied (‘dark’) proteins from analyzed datasets in the context of Reactome’s manually curated pathways.},
