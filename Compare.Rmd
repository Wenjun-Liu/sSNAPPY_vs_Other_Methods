In this R Markdown, we compare three independent pathway analysis methods: *GSEA*, *SPIA* and *fry* against the single-sample pathway analysis method *sSNAPPY*.

# Preparation

Firstly, packages required and the example dataset used in the main manuscript are loaded in. 

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(sSNAPPY)
library(tidyverse)
library(magrittr)
library(ggplot2)
library(patchwork)
library(AnnotationHub) 
library(edgeR)
library(patchwork)
library(colorspace)
library(fgsea)
library(DT)
library(UpSetR) 
library(graphite)
library(SPIA)
library(pander)
library(VennDiagram)
```

```{r formatP}
formatP <- function(p, m = 0.0001){
    out <- rep("", length(p))
    out[p < m] <- sprintf("%.2e", p[p<m])
    out[p >= m] <- sprintf("%.4f", p[p>=m])
    out
}
```

```{r, message=FALSE}
readr::local_edition(1)
logCPM <- readr::read_tsv(here::here("data/logCPM.tsv")) %>%
    column_to_rownames("entrezid")
sample_meta <- read_tsv(here::here("data/sample_meta.tsv"), col_types = "cfccncnc")
dge <- readRDS(here::here("data/dge.rds"))
```

Reactome pathway topology information was retrieved using the `retrieve_topology` function. 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
gsTopology <- retrieve_topology(database = "reactome", species = "hsapiens")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
gsTopology <- readRDS(here::here("data/gsTopology.rds"))
```

Chemotherapy-induced significant pathway perturbation that were detected using *sSNAPPY* on group level were loaded in. 

```{r, message=FALSE}
sSNAPPY_rs <- read_tsv("data/sSNAPPY_output.tsv")
```

# Pathway analysis using other methods

## GSEA

To perform the gene-set enrichment analysis (*GSEA*), differential expresion analysis was firstly performed to derive the ranking statistics of each gene.

### DE Analysis

Differential expression analysis was performed through *edgeR* to test average gene-level chemotherapy treatment response. Model matrix in the form of `model.matrix(~ 0 + patient_id + treatment_phase, data = dge$samples)` was constructed to nest samples by patients. 

```{r fit}
X <- model.matrix(~ 0 + patient_id + treatment_phase,
                  data = dge$samples %>%
                      mutate(treatment_phase = factor(treatment_phase, levels = c("treatment-naive", "post-NACT")))
) %>%
    set_colnames(str_remove_all(colnames(.), "patient_id|treatment_phase")) %>%
    .[,colSums(.) != 0]  
dge <- estimateDisp(dge, design = X, robust = TRUE)
fit <- glmQLFit(dge)
```


```{r topTables}
alpha <- 0.05
topTable <- glmQLFTest(fit, coef = "post-NACT") %>%
      topTags(n = Inf) %>%
      .[["table"]] %>%
      as_tibble() %>%
      mutate(
        location = paste0(seqnames, ":", start, "-", end, ":", strand),
        rankingStat = -sign(logFC)*log10(PValue),
        signedRank = rank(rankingStat),
        DE = FDR < alpha
      ) %>%
      dplyr::select(
        gene_id, gene_name, logCPM, logFC, PValue, FDR, 
        location, gene_biotype, entrezid, ave_tx_len, gc_content,
        rankingStat, signedRank, DE
      )
DEGs <- topTable %>%
    dplyr::filter(DE)
```


Genes with a FDR < 0.05 were determined to be differentially expressed. `r nrow(topTable %>% dplyr::filter(DE))` DEGs were detected among the `r nrow(topTable)` tested genes. The ranking statistic of genes were calculated based on the DE analysis results by `-sign(logFC)*log10(PValue)`.

A named vector where the values are the ranking statistic and the names are genes' entrez id was generated. 

```{r ranked}
load(system.file("extdata", "entrez2name.rda", package = "sSNAPPY"))
temp <- topTable %>%
        mutate(entrezid = paste("ENTREZID:", entrezid, sep = "")) %>%
        drop_na()
ranked_list <- temp %>%
        pull(rankingStat) %>%
        set_names(temp$entrezid)
```

Since *GSEA* is not a topology-based method, the only pathway information required is genes that are included in each pathway. Therefore, row names of each topology matrix were extracted.

```{r}
reactome_gs <- sapply(gsTopology, rownames)
```

```{r}
gsea <-  fgsea(reactome_gs, ranked_list)
gsea_sig <- gsea %>%
    dplyr::filter(padj < 0.05)
```

Using *GSEA* and a significance cut-off of FDR < 0.05, `r nrow(gsea_sig)` out of the `r length(reactome_gs)` tested pathways were considered as significantly enriched, among which 68 pathways were also found to be significantly perturbed by *sSNAPPY*. 

```{r gsea_venn, fig.height=4, fig.width=5, fig.cap="*Overlap between pathways that are considered as significantly impacted by GSEA and sSNAPPY*"}
grid.newpage()
gsea_venn <- venn.diagram(
    list(
        GSEA = gsea_sig$pathway,
        sSNAPPY = sSNAPPY_rs$gs_name
    ), 
    type = "venn", scaled = TRUE, euler.d = TRUE,
    col = c("#ED90A4", "#ACA2EC"), 
    fill = c("#ED90A4", "#ACA2EC"), 
    filename = NULL,
    cat.pos = c(-40, 30)
)
grid.draw(gsea_venn)
```

The full result obtained using GSEA was saved as `output/gsea.tsv`. 

```{r eval = TRUE}
sSNAPPY_sig_path <- sSNAPPY_rs %>%
    dplyr::filter(adj.P.Val < 0.05) %>%
    pull(gs_name)
gsea %>%
    mutate(, 
        `Sig in sSNAPPY` = ifelse(
            pathway %in% sSNAPPY_sig_path, 
            TRUE, FALSE
        ),
        pathway = str_remove_all(pathway, "reactome.")
    ) %>%
    dplyr::select(
        pathway, padj, NES, `Sig in sSNAPPY`
    ) %>%
    write_tsv(
        file = here::here("output/gsea.tsv")
    )
```


## fry

The other non-topology-based method applied to the example dataset is *fry*, which is a fast version of *roast* (rotation gene set testing). Instead of relying on pre-performed DE analysis results, *fry*/*roast* only requires the logCPM matrix and a design matrix as input. 

```{r} 
fry_res <- logCPM %>%
    set_rownames(paste("ENTREZID:", rownames(.), sep = "")) %>%
    fry(
        index = reactome_gs, 
        design  = dge$design, 
        contrast = "post-NACT",
        sort = "directional"
    ) %>%
  rownames_to_column("Pathway")
fry_sig <- fry_res %>%
    dplyr::filter(FDR < 0.05)
```

Using the directional version of *fry* and the same statistics threshold of FDR < 0.05, `r nrow(fry_sig)` pathways were considered as significantly enriched, 44 of which were also considered to be significantly perturbed by *sSNAPPY*. 

```{r fry_venn, fig.height=4, fig.width=5, fig.cap="*Overlap between pathways that are considered as significantly impacted by fry and sSNAPPY*"}
grid.newpage()
fry_venn <- venn.diagram(
    list(
        fry = fry_sig$Pathway,
        sSNAPPY = sSNAPPY_rs$gs_name
    ), 
    type = "venn", scaled = TRUE, euler.d = TRUE,
    fill = c("#ACA2EC", "#ABB150"), 
    col = c("#ACA2EC", "#ABB150"), 
    filename = NULL,
    cat.pos = c(-40, 40)
)
grid.draw(fry_venn)
```

The full result obtained using *fry* was saved as `output/fry.tsv`. 

```{r eval = TRUE}
fry_res %>%
    mutate( 
        `Sig in sSNAPPY` = ifelse(
            Pathway %in% sSNAPPY_sig_path, 
            TRUE, FALSE
        ),
        Pathway = str_remove_all(Pathway, "reactome.")
    ) %>%
    dplyr::select(
        Pathway, FDR, `Sig in sSNAPPY`
    ) %>%
    write_tsv(
        file = here::here("output/fry.tsv")
    )
```

## SPIA

Lastly, the topology-based analysis method *SPIA* was also applied. *SPIA* requires the the logFCs of differentially expressed genes as an input and has two component: 1) topology-based perturbation analysis and 2) conventional over-representation analysis. Hence, 2 p-values: pPert and pNDE were derived for each pathway, and are combined using the Fisher's method. 

```{r eval=FALSE}
graphite_reactome <- pathways("hsapiens", "reactome")
graphite_reactome <- convertIdentifiers(graphite_reactome, "ENTREZID")
prepareSPIA(graphite_reactome, "graphite_reactome")
DE_vector <- DEGs$logFC %>%
    set_names(paste("ENTREZID:", DEGs$entrezid, sep = ""))
all_entrez <- dge$genes %>%
    unnest(entrezid) %>%
    drop_na() %>%
    pull(entrezid) %>%
    paste("ENTREZID:", ., sep = "")
spia_res <- runSPIA(de = DE_vector, all = all_entrez, "graphite_reactome")
saveRDS(spia_res, here::here("data/spia_res.rds"))
```

```{r echo=TRUE}
spia_res <- readRDS(here::here("data/spia_res.rds"))
```

```{r}
spia_sig <- spia_res %>%
    dplyr::filter(pGFdr < 0.05) %>%
    mutate(Name = paste("reactome.", Name, sep = ""))
```

By applying a cut-off of 0.05 on the FDR derived from the Fisher p-values, `r nrow(spia_sig)` pathways' activities were considered to be significantly altered. 6 of those pathways were defined to be significantly perturbed by sSNAPPY. It's important to note that compared to the other methods where all pathways were tested, only `r nrow(spia_res)` pathways were tested by SPIA as pathways that did not contain DEGs were left out. 

Most of the pathways that were considered as significantly impacted by *SPIA* are immune-related process. Compared to other methods, sPIA showed a lack of power in detecting significant pathway perturbation. 

```{r}
spia_sig %>%
    dplyr::select(
        Pathway = Name, pNDE,  pPERT, pGFdr, Status) %>%
    pander(
        caption = "Reactome pathways that were considered as significantly impacted
        by chemotherapy throguh SPIA"
    ) 
```

# Comparison

Various numbers of significance were detected using each pathway analysis method, with the highest number of significance returned by GSEA. 

```{r}
allMethod_sig <- list(
        sSNAPPY = sSNAPPY_rs$gs_name, 
        GSEA = gsea_sig$pathway, 
        fry = fry_sig$Pathway, 
        SPIA = spia_sig$Name
    ) 
allMethod_sig %>%
    vapply(length, numeric(1)) %>%
    enframe(
        name = "Method", 
        value = "Number of significance"
    ) %>%
    arrange(`Number of significance`) %>%
    pander(
        caption = "Number of significantly impacted Reactome pathways found by each pathway analysis method."
    )
```

Pathways considered to be significantly impacted by each analysis method were intersected. 

```{r, fig.cap="*Intersection of significantly chemotherapy-induced changes in Reactome pathway activities that were detected using sSNAPPY, GSEA, fry and SPIA. 2 pathways were consistently significant while 3 pathways were defined to be significant by all methods but SPIA*"}

allMethod_sig %>%
    fromList() %>%
    upset(
        sets = colnames(.), 
        nintersects = NA, 
        queries = list(
          list(query = intersects,
               params = list(names(allMethod_sig)),
               color = "orange",
               active = T), 
          list(query = intersects,
               params = list(names(allMethod_sig)[-4]),
               color = "purple",
               active = T)
        )
    )
```

2 pathways: Translocation of ZAP-70 to Immunological synapse and Generation of second messenger molecules were found to be significantly impacted by the chemotherapy by all methods, and 32 pathways were significant in results returned by *sSNAPPY*, *fry* and *GSEA*. 

```{r}
overlap_3methods <- allMethod_sig[c("GSEA", "fry", "sSNAPPY")] %>%
    Reduce(intersect,.) %>%
    setdiff(., allMethod_sig$SPIA)
```

The 32 pathways that were significant in results returned by all 3 methods were: `r str_remove_all(overlap_3methods, "reactome.")`.

The DNA damage response and repair pathway **SUMOylation of DNA damage response and repair proteins** was reported in the original study and considered as significantly impacted by all 3 methods: *sSNAPPY*, *fry* and *GSEA*. However, only *sSNAPPY* is capable of accounting for gene-gene interaction to predict the directionality of change in pathway acitvities.
